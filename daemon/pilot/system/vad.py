"""Lightweight energy-based voice activity detection (VAD) and utterance
endpointing for the continuous voice listener (see voice.py).

No ML model, no new dependency — a simple RMS-over-threshold classifier
with hysteresis (separate frame counts for confirming speech has STARTED
vs. confirming it has ENDED), so it doesn't chatter on a single loud click
or cut off mid-word during a natural pause between words. Pure/stateful
classes with no sounddevice/hardware dependency, so this is fully
unit-testable without a real microphone — only the actual audio capture in
voice.py's _ContinuousRecorder needs real hardware.

This replaces ContinuousVoiceListener's previous approach of recording a
BLIND fixed-duration window (3s to catch a wake word, 8s for the command
that follows) regardless of how long the person actually spoke — the fixed
window either cuts someone off mid-sentence or wastes time waiting out a
window after they've already finished talking. Endpointing on actual
silence removes both problems and is the mechanical basis for the
barge-in/interrupt behavior in voice.py: the same energy-threshold check
that detects "utterance started" during listening also detects "user
started talking" while Heliox is mid-speech.
